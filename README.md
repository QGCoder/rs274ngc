# rs274ngc

 Git mirror of the original NIST [RS274NGC G-code interpreter](https://code.google.com/archive/p/rs274ngc/).

## About

This is the RS274 (G-code) Interpreter developed for the Next Generation Controller project.

It reads numerical control code and produces calls to a set of canonical machining functions. The interpreter is a software system written in the C++ programming language. The output of the interpreter may be used to drive 3-axis to 6-axis machining centers. Input to the interpreter is RS274 code in the dialect defined by the Next Generation Controller (NGC) project, with modifications. The interpreter may be compiled as a stand-alone computer program or may be integrated with the NIST Enhanced Machine Controller (EMC) control system. Input can come from a file or from a user typing on a computer keyboard. Output commands can either be printed for future use or be executed directly on a machining center.
