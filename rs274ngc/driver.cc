   The values of print_stack and do_next are set.

   Called By: main

   This function allows the user to set one or two aspects of error handling.

   By default the driver does not print the function stack in case of error.
   This function always allows the user to turn stack printing on if it is off
   or to turn stack printing off if it is on.

   When interpreting from the keyboard, the driver always goes ahead if there
   is an error.

   When interpreting from a file, the default behavior is to stop in case of
   an error. If the user is interpreting from a file (indicated by args being
   2 or 3), this lets the user change what it does on an error.

   If the user has not asked for output to a file (indicated by args being 2),
   the user can choose any of three behaviors in case of an error (1) continue,
   (2) stop, (3) go into MDI mode. This function allows the user to cycle among
   the three.

   If the user has asked for output to a file (indicated by args being 3),
   the user can choose any of two behaviors in case of an error (1) continue,
   (2) stop. This function allows the user to toggle between the two.

   The executable exits with either 0 (under all conditions not listed
   below) or 1 (under the following conditions):
   1. A fatal error occurs while interpreting from a file.
   2. Read_tool_file fails.
   3. An error occurs in rs274ngc_init.

   ***********************************************************************

   Here are three ways in which the rs274abc executable may be called.
   Any other sort of call to the executable will cause an error message
   to be printed and the interpreter will not run. Other executables
   may be called similarly.

   1. If the rs274abc stand-alone executable is called with no arguments,
   input is taken from the keyboard, and an error in the input does not
   cause the rs274abc executable to exit.

   EXAMPLE:

   1A. To interpret from the keyboard, enter:

   rs274abc

   ***********************************************************************

   2. If the executable is called with one argument, the argument is
   taken to be the name of an NC file and the file is interpreted as
   described in the documentation of interpret_from_file.

   EXAMPLES:

   2A. To interpret the file "cds.abc" and read the results on the
   screen, enter:

   rs274abc cds.abc

   2B. To interpret the file "cds.abc" and print the results in the file
   "cds.prim", enter:

   rs274abc cds.abc > cds.prim

   ***********************************************************************

   Whichever way the executable is called, this gives the user several
   choices before interpretation starts

   1 = start interpreting
   2 = choose parameter file
   3 = read tool file ...
   4 = turn block delete switch ON
   5 = adjust error handling...

   Interpretation starts when option 1 is chosen. Until that happens, the
   user is repeatedly given the five choices listed above.  Item 4
   toggles between "turn block delete switch ON" and "turn block delete
   switch OFF".  See documentation of adjust_error_handling regarding
   what option 5 does.

   User instructions are printed to stderr (with fprintf) so that output
   can be redirected to a file. When output is redirected and user
   instructions are printed to stdout (with printf), the instructions get
   redirected and the user does not see them.
