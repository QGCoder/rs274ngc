 canon.cc
 .
 This file contains two sets of functions:
 1. functions for the interpreter to call to tell the rest of the world to
 do something. These all return nothing.
 2. functions for the interpreter to call to get information from the rest
 of the world. These all return some type of information.
 These functions implement the interface between the RS274NGC interpreter
 and some external environment.
 .
 This version of canon.cc also includes a third set of stuff: a dummy
 model of the external world. The dummy model is used by the second set
 of interface functions.

 rs274ngc.cc
 .
 This rs274ngc.cc file contains the source code for (1) the kernel of
 several rs274ngc interpreters and (2) two of the four sets of interface
 functions declared in canon.hh:
 1. interface functions to call to tell the interpreter what to do.
 These all return a status value.
 2. interface functions to call to get information from the interpreter.
 .
 Kernel functions call each other. A few kernel functions are called by
 interface functions.
