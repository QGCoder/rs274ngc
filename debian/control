Description: Original NIST RS274NGC G-code interpreter
 This is the RS274 (G-code) Interpreter developed for the Next Generation
 Controller project.
 .
 It reads numerical control code and produces calls to a set of canonical
 machining functions. The interpreter is a software system written in the C++
 programming language. The output of the interpreter may be used to drive 3-axis
 to 6-axis machining centers. Input to the interpreter is RS274 code in the
 dialect defined by the Next Generation Controller (NGC) project, with
 modifications. The interpreter may be compiled as a stand-alone computer
 program or may be integrated with the NIST Enhanced Machine Controller (EMC)
 control system. Input can come from a file or from a user typing on a computer
 keyboard. Output commands can either be printed for future use or be executed
 directly on a machining center.
